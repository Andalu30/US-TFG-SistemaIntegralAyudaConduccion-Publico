Driving assistance systems are one of the most important systems in today's vehicles.
They've become an important consideration for clients when choosing a new vehicle, as they want a secure vehicle that keeps their families safe, as well as for the companies that create them because this systems are a required step in order to eventually achieve full self-driving.

However, this type of systems are usually only found in luxury vehicles or they are behind a paywall.

Because of this, in this project we describe the design and implementation of an integral driving assistance system based on embedded systems, computer vision and artificial intelligence models that is relatively easy to install in any type of vehicle.

The main objective is to be able to warn the driver, acoustically and/or visually, when we detect any type of anomaly. 

In order to meet this objective we've developed a piece of Python software that allow us to connect to a simulator and obtain information about the interior and exterior of the the vehicle thanks to the use of a few types of simulated hardware sensors, process this information and analyze the current and future state of the vehicle.
